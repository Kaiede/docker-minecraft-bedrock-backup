[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/kaiede/minecraft-bedrock-backup.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/kaiede/minecraft-bedrock-backup)

Docker container for configuring backups of the Minecraft [Bedrock](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server) and [Java](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server) docker containers provided by itzg.

This container uses https://github.com/Kaiede/Bedrockifier as the service and command line tool to do all the work. 

**To make development easier this repo has been merged with Bedrockifier, and is now archived. Please bring all issues to  https://github.com/Kaiede/Bedrockifier**
